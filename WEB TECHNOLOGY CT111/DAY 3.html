            <h2 style="font-size:30px;font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>MOBILE SOCIAL MEDIA</i></h2>
            <p style="font-size:30px;background-color:darksalmon">Mobile social media refers to the use of social media on mobile devices such as smartphones and tablet computers.<br> 
               Mobile social media are useful applications of mobile marketing because the creation, exchange, and circulation of 
               user-generated content can assist companies with marketing research, communication, and relationship development.<br>
               Mobile social media differ from others because they incorporate the current location of the user <u>(location-sensitivity)</u>
               or the time delay between sending and receiving messages.</p><hr>
            <h2 style="font-size:30px;font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>TRUSTWORTHINESS AND RELIABILITY</i></h2>
            <p style="font-size:30px;background-color:darksalmon">There has been speculation[by whom?] that social media has become perceived as a trustworthy source of information by a large number of people.<br>
               The continuous interpersonal connectivity on social media, for example, may lead to people regarding peer recommendations as indicators of 
               the reliability of information sources.<br> <mark>This trust can be exploited by marketers, who can utilize consumer-created content about brands and
               products to influence public perceptions.</mark> <br>The trustworthiness of information can be improved by fact-checking. Some social media has started to employ this.</p><hr>
            <h2 style="font-size:30px;font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>CRITICISM OF COMMERZIALISATION</i></h2>
            <p style="font-size:30px;background-color:darksalmon">The commercial development of social media has been criticized as the actions of consumers in these settings have become increasingly value-creating, 
               for example when consumers contribute to the marketing and branding of specific products by posting positive reviews.<br> As such, value-creating activities also 
               increase the value of a specific product, which could, according to marketing professors Bernad Cova and Daniele Dalli (2009), lead to what they refer to as "double exploitation."
               <br>Companies are getting consumers to create content for the companies' websites for which the consumers are not paid.</p><hr>
            <h2 style="font-size:30px;font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>CENSORSHIP BY GOVERNMENT</i></h2>
            <p style="font-size:30px;background-color:darksalmon">Social media often features in political struggles to control public perception and online activity.<br>In some countries, Internet police or secret police monitor or control citizens'
               use of social media.<mark> For example, in 2013 some social media was banned in Turkey after the Taksim Gezi Park protests.</mark> Both Twitter and YouTube were temporarily suspended in the 
               country by a court's decision. A new law, passed by Turkish Parliament, has granted immunity to Telecommunications Directorate (TİB) personnel.The TİB was also given the authority 
               to block access to specific websites without the need for a court order.<br>Yet TİB's 2014 blocking of Twitter was ruled by the constitutional court to violate free speech.</p><hr>
